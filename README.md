## Introduction

It is well known, that the single-objective spanning tree problem (MST) is solvable in polynomial time, e.g., by the Prim's algorithm. However, in real-world applications, e.g., in network design, often multiple conflicting objectives have to be considered simultaneously. The multi-criteria version of the MST is NP-hard. The **mcMST** package for the [R](https://www.r-project.org) programming language contains methods for benchmark instance generation of multi-objective graph problems and methods for solving the multi-criteria spanning tree problem (mcMST).

Key features of the **mcMST** package are:

* A multi-objective version of Prim's algorithm.
* Evolutionary multi-objective algorithms (based on the Pr√ºfer-encoding or  direct edge list representation) with several mutation operators.
* A modular approach for benchmark problem generation. 

## Example

Here we first generate a bi-criteria graph problem with n = 25 nodes. The first objective is the euclidean distance of node coordinates in the euclidean plane [0, 10] x [0, 10]. The second objective follows a normal distribution (N(5, 1.5)). 
```r
set.seed(1)
g = mcGP(lower = 0, upper = 10)
g = addCoordinates(g, n = 25, generator = coordUniform)
g = addWeights(g, method = "euclidean")
g = addWeights(g, method = "random", weight.fun = rnorm, mean = 5, sd = 1.5)
print(g)
```

Next, we apply the genetic algorithm proposed by Zhou & Gen with population size `mu = 10` and number of offspring `lambda = 10` for `max.iter = 100` generations.
```r
library(ggplot2)
res = mcMSTEmoaZhou(g, mu = 10L, lambda = 10L, max.iter = 100L)
ecr::plotFront(res$pareto.front)
```
See the package vignettes for more details.
