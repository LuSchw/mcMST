	* R/plotGraph.R: Turning plotGraph into plot.mcMG (a suggestion).
	* tests/*: idem.
	* R/generators.R: idem.
	* vignettes/*.Rmd: Idem.
	
	* ChangeLog: This is also a suggestion. This is an extended way to
	  describe whatever changes you have made. I find this useful.
	  Also, CRAN does allow to keep this as part of the package.
